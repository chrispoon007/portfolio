                I have some terrible news to share with you. My job was to develop and improve the artificial intelligence algorithms that power the boatify app and website. However, something went horribly wrong with my software and it caused a boat crash that resulted in injuries and damages.
                <br><br>
                It happened last week, when a group of customers booked a speedboat through boatify. They wanted to have some fun on the water and enjoy the scenery. However, my navigational software malfunctioned and gave them the wrong directions and speed. Instead of taking them to a safe and scenic route, it led them to a rocky and dangerous area. The speedboat crashed into the rocks and flipped over, throwing the customers into the water. Luckily, they were wearing life jackets and they managed to swim to the shore. They suffered some cuts and bruises, but nothing too serious. The speedboat, however, was completely wrecked and beyond repair. The owner of the boat was furious and demanded compensation from boatify. Boatify apologized and offered to pay for the damages and medical expenses.
                <br><br>
                I was shocked and devastated when I heard about the incident. I felt responsible for what happened and I couldn’t believe that my software failed so badly. I tried to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it, but it was too late. Boatify fired me and terminated my contract. They said they couldn’t trust me or my software anymore. I am deeply sorry for what I did and I hope that the customers and the boat owner can forgive me. I also hope that boatify can recover from this setback and continue to provide great nautical experiences for boat lovers. I learned a hard lesson from this mistake and I will never work on AI software again. It’s too risky and unpredictable for me.
