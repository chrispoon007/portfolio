                    Hey everyone, I have some exciting news to share with you. I just got a new job as a Nautical AI Developer at boatify. 
                    <br><br>What is boatify, you ask? Well, it’s a cool platform that lets you rent awesome boats from other people and have fun on the water. My job is to make the boatify app and navigational systems smarter and better, using artificial intelligence.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, I help the app find the perfect boat for you, based on your preferences and budget. I also help the website adjust the prices and availability of the boats, depending on the demand and supply. And I also help make sure that everything is safe and secure when you book a boat or rent out your own. 
                    <br><br>I love boats and AI, and I’m super happy to work with a bunch of amazing people who love them too. We are on a mission to create the best nautical experiences for boat lovers everywhere.
